      <p class="bio">Sergei Takeyourpantsov is a force at both ends of the ice. He uses his exceptional defensive instincts to steal the puck, creating scoring opportunities for his team while his opponents scramble. The Captain uses his elite offensive creativity both to set up his teammates, and to attack the net himself to score. Sergei is consistently ranked among the top 100 players in the world, both for points scored and for winning percentage.</p>
